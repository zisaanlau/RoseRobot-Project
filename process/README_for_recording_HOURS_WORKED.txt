Each student has a file in this folder:
  -- hours-1.txt   for the m1 person
  -- hours-2.txt   for the m2 person
  -- hours-3.txt   for the m3 person
  -- hours-4.txt   for the m4 person (for 4-person teams)

You should record, in your OWN hours-X.txt file,
ALL the hours worked on this project, as follows:

1. At the beginning of EVERY work session on this project,
   note the time.

2. At the end of that work session, put into your OWN hours-X.txt file:
   a. the time spent during that work session,
   b. the date, and
   c. a brief description of what you did during that work session.

Notes:
  -- Your team can decide whatever format you want to use
       to enter this information.  The person implementing the Feature
       that requires displaying "hours worked" on the GUI should
       lead the effort to decide the format that the team chooses.

  -- If a work session is longer than 2 hours, break the session 
       into sub-work sessions of no more than 2 hours.

  -- Even if a work session is 2 hours or less, break the session
       into sub-work sessions if there are natural divisions.
       For example, you might have:
          0.5 - 5/3 made the Connect button show up and respond
          1.0 - 5/3 made the Connect button do what it is required to do

  -- Units of half-hours are fine.  So your times would all be one of:
       0.5
       1.0
       1.5
       2.0
     Combine or round up as needed to use those increments.
     Your team can allow smaller increments if you wish,
     but the half-hour increments are fine.
